/**
 * Shape specialization allows us to optimize comparison logic by guaranteeing certain constraints about the
 * configuration of vertices in a given shape. For example, most block shapes consist of only one cuboid and by
 * nature, only one voxel. This fact can be taken advantage of to create an optimized implementation which avoids
 * scanning over voxels as there are only ever two given vertices in the shape, allowing simple math operations to be
 * used for determining intersection and penetration.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, comparison logic is rather simple as the game often only deals with empty shapes or simple cubes.
 * Specialization provides a significant speed-up to entity collision resolution and various other parts of the game
 * without needing invasive patches, as we can simply replace the types returned by this class. Modern processors
 * (along with the help of the potent JVM) make the cost of dynamic dispatch negligible when compared to the execution
 * times of shape comparison methods.

     * Vanilla implements some very complex logic in this function in order to allow entity boxes to be used in

     * represent these cases with nothing more than the two vertexes. This provides a modest speed up for entity
     * collision code by allowing them to also use our optimized shapes.
     * <p>
     * Vanilla uses different kinds of VoxelShapes depending on the size and position of the box.
     * A box that isn't aligned with 1/8th of a block will become a very simple ArrayVoxelShape, while others
     * will become a "SimpleVoxelShape" with a BitSetVoxelSet that possibly has a higher resolution (1-3 bits) per axis.
     * <p>
     * Shapes that have a high resolution (e.g. extended piston base has 2 bits on one axis) have collision
     * layers inside them. An upwards extended piston base has extra collision boxes at 0.25 and 0.5 height.
     * Slabs don't have extra collision boxes, because they are only as high as the smallest height that is possible
     * with their bit resolution (1, so half a block).
