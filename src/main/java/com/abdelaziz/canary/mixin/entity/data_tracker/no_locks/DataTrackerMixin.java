/**
 * The vanilla implementation of {@link DataTracker} performs locking when fetching or updating data due to a legacy
 * quirk in older versions of the game where updates would occur on a network thread for (de)serialization while entities
 * were ticking and accessing values from it on the main thread. In newer versions (1.14+) this no longer happens.
 * <p>
 * The DataTracker is expected to only ever updated on the main-thread (or the thread owning it in recent versions when
 * baking entities) during entity initialization and main-thread network updates, and as such the locking mechanism
 * is unnecessary since the job is to only protect against simultaneous reading and writing.
